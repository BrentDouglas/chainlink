== Installation

The Chainlink distribution can be downloaded from the Maven Central
repository. Two versions are available, one contains the installation
script and every jar required for a full install of Chainlink. The
second only contains the installation script and relies on Maven to
fetch the required jars. One of them is required for all but embedded
usage.
